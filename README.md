# Schematron Enhancement Proposals

This repository collects proposals to enhance Schematron beyond the ISO specification. One goal of this repository is to
decouple proposed enhancements to the Schematron from its implementations.

The changes are worked out in more detail in the [wiki](https://github.com/Schematron/schematron-enhancement-proposals/wiki)
